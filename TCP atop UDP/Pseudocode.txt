Server:

3 way handshake

While true
	
	check ACKs for retrasmit
	//tentatively do messy timeouts
	receive from socket
	
	if socket is not empty, process socket information
	else continue
	
	check window size
	
		if under window size
			send packet
		else continue


Client:

3 way handshake

while true
	
	receive packets from socket; block until packet is received. 
	if last packet, break out of while loop
	
	update window and ACK information
	
	send ack
	
	
	
	
Incremental dev
1. have server send everything & not care about reply. 
2. have client reply with ACKS.
3. have server acknowledge ACKS.
4. implement server window and client window. 
5. implement retransmit.
